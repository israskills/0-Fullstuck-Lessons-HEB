Write a program that takes a number from the user and displays the sum of its digits. The length of the number is unknown.
Example:
If the user enters the number 1234, the result will be: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
If the user enters the number 3664, the result will be: 3 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 19.

The result can be displayed using alert.

Write a program that takes a number from the user and displays a message indicating whether the number is prime or not.
A prime number is a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself, without any other divisors.

Example:
7 — is a prime number,
13 — is a prime number,
21 — is not a prime number,
40 — is not a prime number.

The message can be displayed using alert.
